      <h3>Katerina Sofroniou</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a first year student studying Computer Science at City, University of London.
        I have always been interested in technology and computers, but started coding when
        I was in year 8 and 12 years old. I have taught myself many programming languages
        (such as Javascript, HTML and CSS) as well as learning Java and Python within school
        and university. When I'm not doing work or coding, I prefer to play games, play the piano
        or paint something.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: MP3 Player with a Visualiser</h3>
    <p>To conlude Bootcamp 2020, I created an MP3 Player which displays the album cover, artist,
        album and release date of the song; it also uses an audio visualiser to add more interest
        to the project.</p>

    <p> You are able to interact with the MP3 Player in many ways. For example, you can use 'a' to go back
        to the previous song or press 's' to skip to the next one. The full list of buttons that you can
        use is under the help page (which you access by pressing 'h').</p>

    <p> I decided to create this as it enabled
        me to show that I can use multiple different aspects to Java - I can do sound processing and audio
        visual processing, plus, it showed that I am able to implement switch cases, if statements (including nested
        ones) and also user interaction. </p>
